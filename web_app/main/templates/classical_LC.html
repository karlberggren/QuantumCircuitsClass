                <h3>Inductor </h3>
                <p> An inductor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that stores energy in a magnetic field when electric current flows through it. 
				Inductor is characterized by its inductance, which is the ratio of the voltage to the rate of change of current. The SI unit of inductance 
				is the Henry (H).
				An electric current flowing through a conductor generates a magnetic field surrounding it. The magnetic flux linkage \( \Phi \) generated 
				by a given current \( I \) is related by the inductance \( L \), thus \( L = \Phi / I \).
				<p> Any change in the current through an inductor creates a changing flux, hence induces a voltage across the inductor. From Faraday's 
				law of induction, the voltage induced by any change in magnetic flux through the circuit is given by \( V_L = d{\Phi} / dt = L d{I} / dt \).
				<p> In a pure inductor, the energy is stored in its magnetic field without loss and is returned to the rest of the circuit when the current 
				through the inductor decreases. The inductive energy is given by \( W_L = \frac{1}{2}LI^2 = \Phi^2/(2L) \).

            <h3>Capacitors</h3>
            <p> A capacitor is a passive electronic component with two terminals and it stores electric charge in an electric field. A capacitor consists of 
                two conductors separated by a non-conductive region. The non-conductive region can either be a vacuum or an electrical insulator material known 
                as a dielectric. The capacitor is defined by a term called capacitance \( C \) which is defined as the ratio of the positive or negative charge 
                \( Q \) on each conductor to the voltage \( V \) between them: \( C = Q / V \). The current-voltage relation of a capacitor is given by 
                \( I = dQ / dt = C d{V} / dt \).
                </p> To increase the charge and voltage on a capacitor, work must be done by an external power source to move charge from the negative to the 
                positive plate against the opposing force of the electric field. The total energy \( W_C \) is stored in the increased electric field between the 
                plates and is given by \( W_C = \frac{1}{2}CV^2 = Q^2/(2C) \).

            <h3>Classical LC Circuit</h3>
            <p> An LC circuit is an electric circuit consisting of an inductor and a capacitor connected together. The circuit acts as an electrical 
                resonator, an electrical analog of a classical harmonic oscillator, storing energy oscillating at the circuit's resonant frequency.
                </p> 
                <p> Consider the undriven LC circuit as shown here. The state variables for this system are considered to be the charge on its capacitor, 
                \( Q(t) = CV(t) \), and the flux through its inductor, \( \Phi(t) = LI(t) \). Furthermore, we will consider the behavior of this system for 
                \( t ≥ 0 \) when one or both of the initial state variables are non-zero, i.e., \( Q(0) ≠ 0 \) and/or \( \Phi(0) ≠ 0 \). The circuit will 
                then undergo simple harmonic motion, i.e., the energy stored in the circuit will move back and forth between being electrical (stored in the 
                capacitor) and magnetic (stored in the inductor) as the voltage and current oscillate sinusoidally at the resonant frequency \( \omega = 1 / LC \).
                The equations of motion for our LC circuit are </p>
                <p>  \[ dQ(t) / dt = C d{V}(t) / dt = I(t) = \Phi (t) / L\] 
                 \[ d\Phi (t) / dt = L d{I}(t) / dt = -V(t) = Q(t) / C\] </p>
                <p> The energy stored in the capacitor and the inductor are, respectively, \( \frac{1}{2}CV(t)^2\) and \( \frac{1}{2}LI(t)^2\), so that the 
                total energy (the Hamiltonian) for the circuit is
                 <b> \[ \mathcal{H} = \frac{1}{2}CV(t)^2 + \frac{1}{2}LI(t)^2\ = Q^2/(2C) + \Phi^2/(2L) \]</b> </p>
                <p> Here, the Hamiltonian is a constant, because the LC circuit is both undriven and undamped, i.e., it is passive and lossless.

            <h3>Mechanical Analog of Classical LC Circuit</h3>
			</p> The analogous mechanical system to the LC oscillator is a simple mass-spring system with mass m and inverse-spring constant \( k^{-1} \). 
			In this oscillator, the displacement of the spring \( x \) and the momentum of the mass \( p \) form the equivalent conjugate variables to the 
			system as charge and flux in the electrical circuit. The mechanical oscillator has the resonant frequency \( \omega = k / m \). </p>
			<p> In the classical LC circuit, energy changes between the capacitive energy \( E_C = Q^2/2C \) and the inductive energy \( E_L = \Phi^2/(2L)\). 
			For the mass-spring system, the energy also oscillates between kinetic energy (\( p^2/2m \)) and potential energy (\( \frac{1}{2}kx^2 \)). 
			Therefore, we have a classical Hamiltonian for this system: 
			 \[H = p^2/2m + \frac{1}{2}kx^2 \]  
             which is a constant, as expected.</p>

            <h3>Differential Equation of LC Circuit</h3>
            <p> The two-element LC circuit is also referred to as a second order LC circuit to distinguish it from more complicated (higher order) 
			LC networks with more inductors and capacitors. We assume that the circuit is energized with the initial conditions of \( V_C(0−) = V_0 \)
			and \( I_L(0−) = 0 \). The goal is to analyze this circuit for \( t ≥ 0 \) without any external source.  </p>
            <p> By Kirchhoff's voltage law, we can write \( V_C + V_L = 0 \)
			 By Kirchhoff's current law, we can write \( I_C + I_L = 0 \) </p>
			<p> From the constitutive relations for the circuit elements, we also know that
			 \[ V_L(t) = L (d{I_L} / dt) \] 
			\[ I_C(t) = C (d{V_C} / dt) \]
			 Rearranging and substituting gives the second order differential equation \( (d^2 / dt) I(t) + (1 / LC) I(t) = 0 \)</p> 
             <p> Thus, the resulting solution becomes:
			 \[ I(t) = I_0 cos(\omega t + \phi) \]
			\[ V(t) = L d{I_L} / dt = -\omega L I_0 sin(\omega t + \phi) \] 
			 where angular frequency \( \omega = 1 / LC \) and \( \phi \) is the phase angle. </p>

            <h3>Simulating Second Order Circuits in LTspice</h3>
			<p> We can simulate the natural response of a source free LC circuit using LTspice. We performed the analysis of a source free series 
			LC circuit. In this example, we set the initial inductor current to \( 0 A \) and the initial capacitor voltage to \( 0.2 V \). After 
			entering the schematic, the initial conditions of capacitor and inductor are entered in the IC box. Then a transient analysis with a 
			stop time of \( 10 \) seconds is initialized. After the simulation is complete a graph of the output voltage and current will appear which 
			agrees with the solutions of second order LC circuit equations. </p>
