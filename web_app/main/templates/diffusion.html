                <h3>The Evolution of Wavefunctions in Free Space</h3>
                <p>
                    
                    The Schrodinger equation is describes the evolution of quantum systems in time.
                    One interesting question to ask if whether the Schrodinger equation has a diffusive nature to it. 
                    More precisely, what information about the behaivour of the Schrodinger equation can we get if we compare it to the Diffusion equation?
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the case of a free particle potential, where the capacitance of an LC circuit is much greater than its inductance, the Schrodinger equation looks like this:

                    \[ i \hbar \frac{d}{d t}|\Psi(t)\rangle=\hat{H}|\Psi(t)\rangle \]
                    \[ i \hbar \frac{d\Psi}{d t} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2L} \frac{d^2 \Psi}{d\phi^2} \]
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this case, the Schrodinger equation resembles the diffusion equation:
                    \[ \frac{dT}{dt} = D \frac{d^2T}{dx^2} \]

                    Comparing these two equations we might be able to suggest that \( i\frac{\hbar}{2L} \) could be analogous to \(D\) the diffusion coefficient for the schrodinger equation.
                    The second similarity between these two equations is that a single derivative in time is related to a double derivative in the space coordinate.
                    We can thus expect that there may be some similar behaivour between the two equations. 
                </p>
                <h3>Exploring the Diffusion Equation</h3>
                <p>
                    The diffusion equation is found in many physical and chemical systems.
                    We have an understanding that particles diffuse from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration.
                    Lets see how this works:

                    More precisely, it describes how a wavefunction changes in time when it is inside a Hamiltonian (ie. a potential).
                    The equation with time dependence is typically quoted as follows:
                    \[ i \hbar \frac{d}{d t}|\Psi(t)\rangle=\hat{H}|\Psi(t)\rangle \]

                    We can break it down into its parts like so:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The left hand side of the equation \( i \hbar \frac{d}{d t}|\Psi(t)\rangle \) represents the derivative in time
                            the wavefunction \( |\Psi(t)\rangle \) (recall Bra-Ket notation from the previous sec.). Note that this may be a complex quantity.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The right hand side of the equation, involves how the Hamiltonian \( \hat{H} \) acts on the wavefunction \( |\Psi(t)\rangle \).
                            This encapsulates the description of the energy of the system.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    The time-dependent Schrodinger equation says that the way in which the wavefunction \( |\Psi(t)\rangle \) evolves in time is given by the energy of the given wavefunction in the system. 
                    This is analogous to an equation of motion in classical mechanics, however, we only use the first derivative of the wavefunction.
                </p>

                <h3>LC potentials</h3>
                <p> 
                    We can describe the evolution of LC circuits with the following Hamiltonian:
                    \[ H = \frac{Q^2}{2C} + \frac{\Phi^2}{2L} \]
                    Here we use \(Q\) to represent the charge in the circuit and \(\Phi\) to represent the magnetic flux in the circuit.
                    \(C\) and \(L\) represent the capacitance and the inductance in the circuit. To turn this into a quantum mechanical Hamiltonian
                    we denote the quantities \(Q\) and \(\Phi\) as operators \(\hat{Q}\) and \(\hat{\Phi}\). 

                    Now with this Hamiltonian we can see how the wavefunctions evolve.

                <p>
                    When the capacitor is much bigger than the inductance (when \(C \gg L\)), the term involving the flux is going to 
                    be bigger than the term involving the charge. In physical terms, the circuit's energy is influenced 
                    more by the inductor than by the capacitor. 
                    We may find that the Hamiltonian looks like this:
