<p>Mon 05 Jul 2021 06:03:21 PM EDT</p>
<p>Trying to debug parametrization.org</p>
<p>The other day at the meeting we found some problems with the timescales involved. Specifically the “mass” (capacitance) has to be insanely small otherwise the simulation timescale becomes very short.</p>
<h2 id="separate-directories">Separate Directories</h2>
<p>First thing I did was separate the directories again, so that now I have “param.py” in a project directory.</p>
<p>I then had to add “main” to the path using the “sys” library, which seems to have worked well.</p>

<p>It is worth plotting the Josephson inductance vs. the critical current to get a sense from about 10 nA to about 1 μA, as these are the scales used in Qubits, and correspond to fluxes on the order of Φₒ.</p>
<p>Looking at this, it seems that 1e-6 uA corresponds to about 3 nH.</p>
<p>if f = 1 GHz, then ω ≈ 6 Grad/s so T = 1 ns = 1 / √(L C). ⇒ L C = 1 / T² ⇒ C = 1/(T² L) = 1/(1e-18*1e-9)=1e-27.</p>
<p>Now Δx ~ √(ħ/2 * √(L/C)) ~ √(5e-35<em>√(1e-9/1e-27)) = √(5e-35</em>1e9) ~ 2e-13.</p>
<p>made a qubit circuit calculator in desmos</p>
<p><a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ohpq1wiko6" class="uri">https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ohpq1wiko6</a></p>
<p>The end result was L = 1e-9, C = 1e-15, width is 3 e-16 and period is 6e-12</p>
<p>I feel like I should test it with known quantities, namely set C = ħ² and then the timesteps shoudl be O(1)</p>
<p>OK, I had a few struggles, but it turned out the problem was fundamentally that the plots weren’t updating. Evolve returns a solve_ivp object, but I had been assuming it returned a wavevector (i.e. updated in place).</p>
<p>Indeed, that would be more useufl in the long run.</p>
<p>Once I fixed that, I was able to get everything to evolve in place and look nice on the web page. I now just need to change it back so sliders work etc., as I had tod eisable all that during debugging process.</p>
