# How parameters affect quantum oscillations in an L-C circuit

In this exploration, we consider an L-C circuit that has started in
it's ground state.  This situation would be the natural starting point
for a circuit that hadn't been disturbed in a long time.

We allow for a few possible perturbations and changes, some of which
can made before the experiment starts, and some which can be made in
the midst of the experiment.

In this circuit, we choose the flux in the primary inductor (_L_) to
be the quantization variable.  That means that we will look at the
dynamics of the system as if the flux Î¦ were the position of a
particle evolving in a pseudo-potential consisting of the energy
stored in the inductor.
