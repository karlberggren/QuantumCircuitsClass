<h1 id="how-parameters-affect-quantum-oscillations-in-an-l-c-circuit">How parameters affect quantum oscillations in an L-C circuit</h1>
<p>In this exploration, we consider an L-C circuit that has started in it's ground state. This situation would be the natural starting point for a circuit that hadn't been disturbed in a long time.</p>
<p>We allow for a few possible perturbations and changes, some of which can made before the experiment starts, and some which can be made in the midst of the experiment.</p>
<p>In this circuit, we choose the flux in the primary inductor (<em>L</em>) to be the quantization variable. That means that we will look at the dynamics of the system as if the flux Î¦ were the position of a particle evolving in a pseudo-potential consisting of the energy stored in the inductor.</p>
